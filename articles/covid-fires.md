_Update:_ In retrospect this was an exceedingly bad take. There probably will be an uptick, but there's little evidence the fires I listed were deliberate.

[An apartment fire][fire1] that happened a month ago, thought to be an arson

Former location of a popular local business [burns down][fire2]

Random fire downtown SLC that is [suspected to be an arson][fire3]

Mark my words: there will be an abundance of small business fires this year as people try to cash in on insurance money as an effect of being shut down for so long. I think everyone knew that many locally owned businesses were never going to recover from being locked down; profit margins on restaurants are notoriously small. Even after opening up, many places are probably experiencing way less business than they were before while their expenses for day-to-day operations are mostly unchanged. I would not be surprised if a lot of businesses had firework related fires this weekend. 

Maybe if the president would stop propping up a culture that thinks masks are for pussies we could avoid a second shutdown and save some more businesses (and, ya know, lives). OR... maybe if the government would actually give people meaningful material help, they wouldn't feel like they needed to burn their business down.
