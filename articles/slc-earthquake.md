## March 18, 2020 Salt Lake Earthquake
Woke up to my snooze alarm at around 7:10-7:15 AM and within seconds my whole building was shaking. The shaking lasted maybe 20 to 30 seconds with aftershocks coming a few minutes after. I probably felt the last aftershock around 8:00 AM. 

It was a [magnitude 5.7][sl] earthquake that seems to have occurred in Magna. The University of Utah's [seismograph monitoring website][uu] seems to be overwhelmed, so secondary news sources are all that is easily available right now.
