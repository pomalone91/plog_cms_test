Utah's weird Covid-19 stats

Utah is somewhat of an anomaly when it comes to Covid-19. If you just look at the number of cases we have (at time of writing), it seems about inline with what we see in other states with similar populations.

<table>
    <tr><th>State</th>           <th>Total Cases</th>   <th>Total Deaths</th>   <th>Cases/1M</th>    <th>Deaths/1M</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Alabama</td>         <td>9,486</td>	        <td>388</td>	        <td>1,935</td>	     <td>79</td></tr>
    <tr><td>North Dakota</td>    <td>1,464</td>	        <td>35</td>	            <td>1,921</td>	     <td>46</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Minnesota</td>       <td>10,790</td>	    <td>558</td>	        <td>1,913</td>	     <td>99</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Utah</td>            <td>6,103</td>	        <td>66</td>	            <td>1,904</td>	     <td>21</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Florida</td>         <td>40,001</td>	    <td>1,716</td>	        <td>1,862</td>	     <td>80</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Wisconsin</td>       <td>9,590</td>	        <td>384</td>	        <td>1,647</td>	     <td>66</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USA</td>             <td>1,341,281</td>	    <td>79,823</td>	        <td>4,052</td>	     <td>241</td></tr>
</table>

I got the above table by sorting data from the Covid-19 tracker on [World Meter][] by Total Cases/1M population. Utah's total death count is incredibly low for how many confirmed cases it has. A mere 66 deaths out of 6,103 cases. If you look at the ratio of deaths to cases of other states with similar incidence of Covid-19, the numbers are quite a bit higher. The likelihood of Covid-19 killing a Utahn seems to be much lower than most other states.

In fact sorting the data from World Meter by Deaths/1M, Utah is only higher than Montana, Alaska and Hawaii.

<table>
    <tr><th>State</th>      <th>Total Cases</th>    <th>Total Deaths</th>   <th>Cases/1M</th>   <th>Deaths/1M</th></tr>
    <tr><td>West Virginia</td>  <td>1,335</td>	        <td>53</td>	            <td>745</td>	    <td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Arkansas</td>	    <td>3,747</td>	        <td>88</td>	            <td>1,242</td>	    <td>29</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Utah</td>	        <td>6,103</td>	        <td>66</td>	            <td>1,904</td>	    <td>21</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Montana</td>	    <td>458</td>	        <td>16</td>	            <td>429</td>	    <td>15</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Alaska</td>	        <td>377</td>	        <td>10</td>	            <td>515</td>	    <td>14</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Wyoming</td>	    <td>644</td>	        <td>7</td>	            <td>1,113</td>	    <td>12</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hawaii</td>	        <td>629</td>	        <td>17</td>	            <td>444</td>	    <td>12</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USA</td>            <td>1,341,281</td>	    <td>79,823</td>	        <td>4,052</td>	    <td>241</td></tr>

So why is Covid-19 having a muted affect in Utah? I don't know for sure, but I have a hunch Mormons are to blame. Utah has the [lowest rate of smoking][] in the nation. It also has the [lowest rate of alcohol usage][] and the [youngest median age][] nationally. It seems like Utahns are just by and large a healthier population.
