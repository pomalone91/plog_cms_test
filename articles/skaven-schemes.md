## Scheming Skaven Color Schemes

Here are some potential color schemes I've been toying with for my Plague Monks. I originally was going to go with the class drab green, but then thought about doing their robes like the [Spanish Inquisition][yt]. I ended up not being completely satisfied with how monochrome that ended up looking, so I went for a two-tone look with black robes and red hoods. For now, I think I'll be sticking with that. Here is the gallery though.
