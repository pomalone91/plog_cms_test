# The Stickiness of Religion
I've heard a fair bit of conversation in the Apple blogosphere about what makes Apple's ecosystem sticky. The concept is that there is something that keeps people using Apple's products even though they could jump to Android or Windows and certainly accomplish many of the same things. The concept applies across pretty much any consumer brand. Most people probably buy the same brand of toothpaste every time. People become loyal to whatever brand of car they eventually latch onto. Maybe its the quality of the product. Maybe it's just what they or their family has always used. Maybe it's the only thing available where they live. Whatever it is, there are aspects of the brand or product that are _sticky_, and disincentives abandoning it.

I no longer consider myself religious, though I was raised with a conservative Christian mind set. I want to talk about what I think makes religion _sticky_, like a consumer products brand. I think that people who grow up in a faith and leave it go through a process of being unstuck to the religion by lessening the importance of some critical functions the religion provides. Losing those functions and not knowing where to find them are probably the biggest dangers of losing one's faith.

1. Community
    - Familial obligation
    - Friends
    - Just being where you live
    - Seeing others with the same cognitive dissonance and continuing.
    - Your church isn't like the others
2. Unconditional love
    - Projecting self love onto Jesus
    - Self love as an irreligious person is fucking hard
    - Critical inner voice
