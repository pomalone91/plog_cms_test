# Face ID Sucks
I was apprehensive of Face ID on the iPhone X when it was first launched. My gut told me that while it might be easier to activate in some situations, there would be plenty where it would be way more frustrating than Touch ID. My fears were pretty much confirmed when I got my hands on the X. I know that Touch ID saw improvements within the hardware, so hopefully it's gotten better on the Xs and 11 Pro, but I'm here to bitch about what I have, so here goes.

## It's Slower than Touch ID was.
This probably bothers me the least, but when Face ID goes off without a hitch, it still feels just a little bit too slow. I'm talking about situations where I bring my phone to my face and immediately swipe up. There are times where I've looked at my lock screen for a second and then swipe up, at which point it's already authenticated and I'm good to go. Those times feel great. Any other situation it just feels slightly too slow though. This is my smallest gripe because I know the hardware has helped improve authentication speed on post-X iPhones.

## It's harder to use in even slightly adverse situations
Here are some situations where Face ID does not or barley works...
- When the camera is in direct sunlight, it just won't work. 
- Setting it on a table and desk off to the side and trying to unlock it. I do this a lot at work and if I want to turn on shuffle or check a text, I've got to wait for Face ID to fail and then type in my passcode (or pick my phone up off the desk). Before I could just set my thumb on the home button. 
- Face is covered by a scarf.
- Sitting with my face resting on my hand.
- Trying to authenticate Siri to do something.

When I am driving and notice out of the corner of my eye that I received a text, before I would just reach over, tap the phone real quick and ask Siri "Read my texts." Siri would then read my messages to me and I'd decide if I wanted to respond or not. I _cannot_ do that now. Siri will not read my texts to me unless I've authenticated, and there are only two ways to do that now
1. Face ID
2. Type my passcode in

To do the first, I would need to pick up and stare at my phone, making unbreaking eye contact with the front facing camera. To make it even worse, it's harder to dodge out of direct sunlight while you're strapped into the driver's seat of your car, so you might need to move around unsafely _while_ you're driving. I'm not going to fucking do that. I know some maniacs are okay with looking at their phone while they drive, but those people should be sent to gulags. I am not okay with that, except for the briefest of glances. I will not look at my phone and wait for it to authenticate while I drive.

To do the second requires probably even more time looking at my phone ('cause it's not like I can feel the keypad on the screen).

So I basically can't use Siri for a very basic function while I'm driving. I will now be missing texts that say "could you pick something up on your way over" or "wait come back you forgot your wallet". Maybe I'll catch it at a red light, but if I'm on the highway, no way.


## It makes Apple Pay more awkward to use
This might be my most petty complaint because it does generally work as intended in this situation, but for me, no complaint is too trivial. I always feel awkward when I check out at a store that uses Apple Pay. I didn't used to, but I do now all thanks to Face ID. See, before I could just maintain eye-contact with the clerk, or at least seem to be attentive in our social interaction. I could just set my thumb on my phone, and set my phone on the NFC reader without much attention. 

Now I need to get my phone and awkwardly look down at it. I feel like every time I do it, someone is thinking "looking at these damn millennials, can't put their phones down for 1 minute!" I'm probably exaggerating how much people notice or care, but it still sort of bothers me. 

## Bring Back Touch ID?
Face ID is remarkable technology. It is obviously _the_ best implementation of unlocking your phone with your face (at least at the time the X came out). But it is not the best way of unlocking your phone. I will be patiently waiting for them to get under the screen Touch ID figured out.
