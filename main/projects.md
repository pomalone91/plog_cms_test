## Projects
Things that I work on intermittently. 

### Termiroll
![termiroll interactive mode](images/termiroll_interactive.png)

If your Macbook also doubles as a GM screen, then Termiroll is for you! Rapidly roll any kind of dice with any modifier in the familiar 1d6+1 format right in your terminal! You can run it once straight from the command line using `roll 1d6+2`. Or you can simply use `roll` and then repeatedly make as many rolls as you like in interactive mode.

#### Installation
You can use [Homebrew][hb] to install Termiroll.

`brew install pomalone91/termiroll/termiroll`

You can visit the project page here on [Github][gh].

### Diceroller

My only real foray into iOS development. You can see the code at [github][ghd].

### This website
I'm steadily building and upgrading the CMS (content management system) for this website. Plog is hosted on [Linode][li]. The content for this website is written using Markdown. I use [John Gruber's][df] markdown perl script to generate the HTML from the Markdown.
